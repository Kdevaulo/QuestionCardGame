- Enter the names of the players in the provided fields, then press the Start button.
- After the gong sounds and the cards appear, the host presses the test card on the left, inviting everyone to answer the question on it.
- Players then select cards and answer the questions in the order in which the names were registered.
  
The game consists of 2 rounds with a break between them. The second round is a rapid-fire survey, with each participant's response time limited to two minutes.
